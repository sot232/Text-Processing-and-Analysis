Create a single program that:

Creates one word list for each of the registers in the Mini-CORE corpus. Exclude all function words from your frequency lists. You can use the list on the following webpage (see the complete list at the bottom of the page): http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/wordscape/museum/funcword.html
Writes each of these word lists to its own file, ordered according to frequency (highest frequency words first).
In 1-2 paragraphs, describe any differences you see between the lists. What can you learn about these registers based on these differences?
