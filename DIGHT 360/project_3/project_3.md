3: Scrape a webpage

Turn in two python scripts and a short writeup which includes a link to your code for the following task:

scraper_<yourname>.py

Choose any website(s) that you would like to scrape and write a script to get the html and save it to a file (<filename>.html).

parser_<yourname>.py

In this script, open the file and pseudo-parse it with a regular expression to extract the information you are interested in. Save that information in another file (<filename>_parsed.txt).

Be sure that your code follows the ethical guidelines discussed in class. (If using pythonanywhere, you can choose a site with an API, because you only scrape one page.) If you go the extra mile and get more than one page from the same server, be certain to include a pause (sleep) between each request!

Some ideas:

Scrape information from Wikipedia
Scrape all the URLs from a google search page (see "Query strings" from lecture notes.)
Scrape the ingredients from a recipe website
Scrape the full text of a book in Project Gutenberg.
Scrape data from a sports statistics website
Scrape information about bills in Congress
